# Data Synchronization README

## Overview

This document outlines the process of synchronizing data between two Azure instances using Python and SQL Server. The scenario involves two instances: one with the correct structure but wrong data, and the other with the right data but wrong structure. The goal is to synchronize the data from the instance with the right data to the instance with the correct structure.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Pyodbc library installed (`pip install pyodbc`)
- Access to both Azure instances

## Steps

### 1. Backup and Preparation

- Before proceeding with any data synchronization, ensure you have backups of both instances' databases to avoid data loss.
- Familiarize yourself with the structure and relationships of both databases to identify discrepancies.

### 2. Data Extraction and Transformation

1. **Extract Correct Data**

   - Use Python to connect to the instance with the right data and extract it into a Pandas DataFrame.
   
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import pyodbc

   # Connect to the correct data instance
   conn_string = "Driver={SQL Server};Server=your_server;Database=your_database;Trusted_Connection=yes;"
   conn = pyodbc.connect(conn_string)

   # Query data
   query = "SELECT * FROM your_table"
   correct_data_df = pd.read_sql(query, conn)

1. Transform Data

    - Perform necessary data transformations on the DataFrame.
   correct_data_df['Column1'] = correct_data_df['Column1'] + 100

### 3. Data Loading and Synchronization

1. Create Temporary Staging

    - In the instance with the correct structure, create a temporary staging table to hold the transformed data.
   -- Create temporary staging table
CREATE TABLE StagingTable (
    ID INT,
    Column1 INT,
    Column2 VARCHAR(50)
);

2. Load Data into Staging

    - Load the transformed data into the staging table using Python and SQL.
   cursor = conn.cursor()

for _, row in correct_data_df.iterrows():
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO StagingTable (ID, Column1, Column2) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
                   row['ID'], row['Column1'], row['Column2'])

conn.commit()

3. Data Mapping and Transformation

    - Write an SQL query to map and transform data from the staging table to the correct table structure.
   -- Synchronize data to the correct structure
MERGE INTO CorrectTable AS target
USING StagingTable AS source
ON target.ID = source.ID
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET target.Column1 = source.Column1, target.Column2 = source.Column2
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (ID, Column1, Column2)
    VALUES (source.ID, source.Column1, source.Column2);

### 4. Verify and Test

    - Run queries to compare data in the correct structure instance against the source instance to ensure data integrity.
    - Test the application or system using the synchronized data to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

### 5. Monitor and Finalize

    - Continuously monitor the application/system for any anomalies or issues arising from the data synchronization.
    - Once you're confident that the synchronization is successful and the application works correctly, consider the process complete.

    Notes

    - Always perform thorough testing in a development or testing environment before applying changes to a production system.
    - This document provides a general overview. Adapt the instructions, code, and queries to your specific environment and technologies.

      
      Remember to replace placeholders like `your_server`, `your_database`, `your_table`, etc., with your actual instance names, database names, and table names.       Also, make sure to adapt any specific details related to your technologies and environment.
